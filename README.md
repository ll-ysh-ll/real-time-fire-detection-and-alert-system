#### YOLO v4 :
YOLO is short for You Only Look Once. It's state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that can recognize multiple objects in a single frame. YOLO recognizes objects more precisely and faster than other recognition systems.


#### Classes used for training :
- Fire

#### Dataset gathering and image annotation:
